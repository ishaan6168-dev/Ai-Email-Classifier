📧 AI Email Classifier
A machine learning project that classifies emails using natural language processing (NLP) and Python. This model processes email text and predicts whether an email falls into different categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam or topic classes).

🧠 Project Overview
Email classification is a classic NLP task where a machine learning model learns to categorize emails based on their content. Such models are useful for:
Spam detection (spam vs. not spam)
Email categorization (folders like work, personal, promotions)
Organizing large inboxes automatically
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate such a classifier in Python using standard libraries like scikit-learn. 

🛠️ Features
✔ Preprocesses email text (cleaning, tokenization)
✔ Converts text into numerical features using NLP techniques like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF
✔ Trains a machine learning classifier on labeled email data
✔ Evaluates model accuracy and performance
✔ Predicts the category for new email inputs
